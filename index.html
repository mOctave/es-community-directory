		<h1>Endless Sky Community Directory</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Endless Sky Community Directory! If you've suddenly forgotten who a member of the community actually is, you've come to the right place.</p>
		<h2>Roles</h2>
		<h3 class="developer">Developer</h3>
		<p>Developers are the people with write access to the GitHub repository. That means they're the ones who have the final say on what gets into the game and what doesn't. Right now, the following people are active* devs for Endless Sky:</p>
		<p><a href="#derpy-horse">Derpy Horse (Amazinite) - Lead Dev</a> • <a href="#anarchist2">Anarchist2</a> • <a href="#petervdmeer">petervdmeer</a> • <a href="#quantumshark">Quantumshark (DoomKorath)</a> • <a href="#roadrunner56">Roadrunner56</a> • <a href="#saugia">Saugia</a> • <a href="#tibetiroka">tibetiroka</a> • <a href="#tomgoodidea">TomGoodIdea</a> • <a href="#warp_core">warp_core</a></p>
		<p>Some developers also have maintenance access to the repository. These devs can be identified by the <span class="maintainer">Maintainer</span> role on their card.</p>

		<h3 class="community-organizer">Community Organizer</h3>
		<p>The community organizers are the people in charge of host events, keeping the community on track, and generally making sure we don't burn the house down the minute Derpy leaves. Our current community organizers are:</p>
		<p><a href="#hecter">Hecter</a> • <a href="#master_of_grey">Master of Grey</a> • <a href="#zoura">Zoura</a></p>

		<h3 class="moderator">Discord Moderators</h3>
		<p>The moderators are in charge of making sure everything stays civil, spam bots get properly cleaned up, and everyone is acting like a reasonably mature, responsible human being. Our active* mods on Discord are:</p>
		<p><a href="#darcy_manoel">Darcy Manoel</a> • <a href="#master_of_grey">Master of Grey</a> • <a href="#nana_scone">Nana Scone</a> • <a href="#warlord_mike">Warlord Mike</a> • <a href="#warp_core">warp_core</a></p>

		<p class="footnote">* "Active" here means that someone's showed their face in the community at some point in the past few months. It doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be free to respond if you ping them right this minute. If you need to reach a mod urgently on Discord, please ping @Moderator.</p>

		<h3 class="oathkeeper">Oathkeepers</h3>
		<p>As well as mods on Discord, we also have a moderation team on GitHub, known internally as the Oathkeepers. They're in charge of ensuring GitHub discussions stay civil and productive, and although they don't see nearly as much action as the Discord mods, the following people are our current Oathkeepers:</p>
		<p><a href="#bene_dictator">bene_dictator</a> • <a href="#danaris">Danaris</a> • <a href="#nana_scone">Nana Scone</a> • <a href="#ziproot">ziproot</a></p>

		<h3>Review Teams</h3>
		<p>Before anything is added to Endless Sky, it undergoes (usually extensive) review. The review teams, which are comprised of Developers and dedicated Reviewers, are the ones in charge of providing that review. In total, there are currently six different review teams for Endless Sky.</p>
		<p>The three main review teams are those dedicated to reviewing art, coding, and writing. Their members are:</p>

		<p><b class="code-patrol">Code Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#hurleveur">Hurleveur</a> • <a href="#koranir">Koranir</a> • <a href="#tibetiroka">Tibetiroka</a> • <a href="#tomgoodidea">TomGoodIdea</a></p>
		<p><b class="art-patrol">Art Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#becca_tommaso">Becca Tommaso</a> • <a href="#daeridanii">Daeridanii</a> • <a href="#gefullte_taubenbrust">Gefüllte Taubenbrust</a> • <a href="#saugia">Saugia</a></p>
		<p><b class="writing-patrol">Writing Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#bene_dictator">bene_dictator</a> • <a href="#ejothims">EjoThims</a> • <a href="#loymdayddaud">Loymdayddaud</a> • <a href="#moctave">mOctave</a> • <a href="#roadrunner56">Roadrunner56</a> • <a href="#reticent_rem">reticent-rem</a> • <a href="#themarksman">TheMarksman</a> • <a href="#tibetiroka">tibetiroka</a></p>

		<p>There are also three other, more specialized review teams:</p>

		<p><b class="theme-patrol">Theme Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#ejothims">EjoThims</a> • <a href="#master_of_grey">Master of Grey</a> • <a href="#zitchas">Zitchas</a></p>
		<p><b class="balance-patrol">Balance Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#quantumshark">Quantumshark (DoomKorath)</a></p>
		<p><b class="mission-patrol">Mission Patrol:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a href="#loymdayddaud">Loymdayddaud</a> • <a href="#terin">Terin</a></p>

		<p>It is worth noting that most devs have accumulated experience in a number of areas of the game, and many frequently make reviews that fall outside their patrol group's area of responsibility.</p>

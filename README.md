# Endless Sky Community Directory

Ever suddenly forget who the person you're talking to is? New to the community and wondering who's who, what happened to MZ (spoiler: he left), and what person or group is in charge of those aliens you love plundering? Check out the directory at https://moctave.github.io/es-community-directory!

## Getting Added to the Directory

I welcome every member of the Endless Sky community to add themselves to the directory. Simply fill out the template in `template.js`, open a PR with your card added to the big `DIRECTORY` object in `main.js`, and you can join the directory. If you're not comfortable with PRs and JSON, you can also open an issue with the information you want to have listed, and I'll add you when I have time.

From time to time, I'll also add members of the community who I think have been suitably influential in one way or another. I'll try to put something reasonably respectful on your card (unless you're Azure), but if you're not happy with what I've put down for you, just open an issue or PR requesting a change.

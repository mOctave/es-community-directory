# Endless Sky Community Directory

Ever suddenly forget who the person you're talking to is? New to the community and wondering who's who, what happened to MZ (spoiler: he left), and what person or group is in charge of those aliens you love plundering? Check out the directory at https://moctave.github.io/es-community-directory!

## FAQ

### How can I get added to the directory?

Everyone is welcome to add themselves to the directory or request to be added. You can do this in one of two ways:

- If you're good with GitHub, fill out `template.js` and open a PR adding your card to the `DIRECTORY` object in `main.js`.
- If you're not comfortable with PRs or JSON syntax, open an issue using the "Add Request" template and I'll add you when I have time.

I may also add some members of the community myself. If I add you to the directory without you giving me anything to add, you'll have some default fields and I'll try to put something reasonably descriptive nice on your card. If you're not happy with your card, feel free to open an issue or PR requesting a change.

### Why isn't X on the directory?

Most likely, it's because I haven't added them yet. If you think there's someone who should be on the directory, let me know on the [issues page](https://github.com/moctave/es-community-directory/issues) or the ES Discord server.

There are also a couple of people who have expressed a wish not to be on the directory, and so they are not part of it. If you wish to be removed from the directory, let me know and I can do so.

### Whoa, are you all non-binary or something?

There's a couple of fields on the directory cards that have default values because not everyone might be comfortable sharing that information. Specifically, pronouns default to `they/them` and country defaults to `Earth`. I suggest that, unless you know of other pronouns someone uses, you also use `they/them` when communicating with them.

### What are Projects?

Projects are links to things that people have contributed significantly to or are currently working on. They are generally divided into plugins (ES mods), forks (mods that are total overhauls of ES and need to be installed seperately), tools, and documents you can read, as well as links to projects that don't fit these categories.

Many people choose to include a projects section when they request to be added to the directory, but it's not mandatory.

### Hecter's name is different on Discord! Why isn't it listed?

Platform-specific names are listed for clarity, but some people change their usernames quite frequently, so the names you see on the directory aren't necessarily *exactly* the same as the ones on other platforms. In general, alternate names are meant to provide a guide to figuring out who someone is when their names are significantly different on different platforms.

### What's the difference between "Active," "On Hiatus," and "Old Member"?

There's no clear distinction between the three statuses, but they generally work as follows:

- Active members are people who've been around recently and are still contributing to the community. Usually, anyone who's been around in the last couple of months is considered active.
- Members on hiatus are people who haven't been seen in a while, but are likely to return eventually.
- Old Members are typically people who haven't been active in a mainstream ES community for at least several months and generally a year or more. They *probably* aren't coming back, but who knows?
